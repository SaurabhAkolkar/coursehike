                            LILA’s mission is to improve lives through learning. We enable anyone anywhere to create
                            and share educational courses (instructors) and to enroll in these educational courses to
                            learn (students). We consider our marketplace model the best way to offer valuable
                            educational content to our users. We need rules to keep our platform and services safe for
                            you, us, and our student and instructor community. These Terms apply to all your activities
                            on the LILA website, the LILA mobile applications, our TV applications, our APIs, and other
                            related services (“Services”).

                                online services where you live (for example, 13 in the US or 16 in Ireland), you may not set
                                up an account, but we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to open an account and

                                Under our Instructor Terms, when instructors publish a course on LILA, they grant LILA a
                                license to offer a license to the course to students. This means that we have the right to
                                sublicense the course to the students who enroll in the course. As a student, when you
                                enroll in a course, whether it’s a free or paid course, you are getting a license from LILA to
                                view the course via the LILA platform and Services, and LILA is the licensor of record.
                                Courses are licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give you any right to resell
                                the course in any manner (including by sharing account information with a purchaser or
                                illegally downloading the course and sharing it on torrent sites).

                                In legal, more complete terms, LILA grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive,

                                you have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, non-commercial, educational

                                restrictions associated with a particular course or feature of our Services. All other uses are
                                expressly prohibited. You may not reproduce, redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast,

                                agreement signed by a LILA authorized representative. This also applies to content you can
                                access via any of our APIs.

                                We generally give a lifetime access license to our students when they enroll in a course.
                                However, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use courses at any point
                                in time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access to a course due to
                                legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course you enrolled in is the object of a copyright
                                complaint, or if we determine its content violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines. The lifetime
                                access is not applicable to add-on features and services associated with a course. For
                                example, translation captions of courses may be disabled by instructors at any time, and
                                instructors may decide at any time to no longer provide teaching assistance or Q&A
                                services in association with a course. To be clear, the lifetime access is to the course
                                content but not to the instructor.

                                these Terms (or our other legal terms) through final and binding arbitration, regardless of
                                the type of claim or legal theory. If one of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated
                                and the other party refuses to arbitrate it, the other party can ask a court to force us both to
                                go to arbitration (compel arbitration). Either of us can also ask a court to halt a court
                                proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.

                            <p class="la-cr__section-para la-anim__stagger-item--x">
                                Any disputes that involve a claim of less than $10,000 USD must be resolved exclusively
                                through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration must initiate
                                proceedings by filing an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association
                                (AAA). The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration
                                Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of
                                Consumer-Related Disputes. You and we agree that the following rules will apply to the
                                proceedings: (a) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, or based solely on
                                written submissions (at the choice of the party seeking relief); (b) the arbitration must not
                                involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses (unless we and you agree
                                otherwise), and (c) any judgment on the arbitrator’s rendered award may be entered in any
                                court with competent jurisdiction. Disputes that involve a claim of more than $10,000 USD
                                must be resolved per the AAA’s rules about whether the arbitration hearing has to be
                                in-person.

                            <h5 class="leading-loose  text--black body-font la-anim__stagger-item la-anim__A">9.4 No Class Actions</h5>
                            <p class="la-cr__section-para la-anim__stagger-item--x">
                                We both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis.
                                This means: (a) neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class
                                action, consolidated action, or representative action; (b) an arbitrator can’t combine multiple
                                people’s claims into a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative
                                action); and (c) an arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact that
                                user, not other users, and can’t be used to decide other users’ disputes. If a court decides
                                that this “No class actions” clause isn’t enforceable or valid, then this “Dispute Resolution”
                                section will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms will still apply.
